of your error message was never \def'ed. If you have
misspelled it (e.g., `\hobx'), type `I' and the correct

For example, `\def\a#1{...}' and `\a}' would produce
this error. If you simply proceed now, the `\par' that
I've just inserted will cause me to report a runaway
argument that might be the root of the problem. But if
your `}' was spurious, just type `2' and it will go away.
